# Covid19_SQL_Data_Analysis

- Used the most updated COVID19 dataset from https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths.
- I did cleaning and formatting processes in excel and then divide the dataset into 2 files to be able to analyze the process on SQL.
- Imported and Exported dataset to MS SQL. The range of a set of data is from February 21, 2020, to March 29, 2022.
- Wrote queries for Data Exploration and Visualization. Used Round, Cast, CTE, MAX, SUM, JOINS, Partition by, and Temp Tables.
